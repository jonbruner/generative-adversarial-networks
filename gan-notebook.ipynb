    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Yann LeCun, “adversarial training is the coolest thing since sliced bread.” Sliced bread certainly never created this much excitement within the deep learning community. Generative adversarial networks—or GANs, for short—have dramatically sharpened the possibility of AI-generated content, and have drawn active research efforts since they were [first described by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661).\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are neural networks that learn to create synthetic data similar to some known input data. For instance, researchers have generated convincing images from [photographs of everything from bedrooms to album covers](https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code), and they display a remarkable ability to reflect [higher-order semantic logic](https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Those examples are fairly complex, but it's easy to build a GAN that generates very simple images. In this tutorial, we'll build a GAN that analyzes lots of images of handwritten digits and gradually learns to generate new images from scratch—*essentially, we'll be teaching a neural network how to write*.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Generative adversarial networks consist of two models: a generative model and a discriminative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![caption](notebook-images/GAN_Overall.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminator model is a classifier that determines whether a given image looks like a real image from the dataset or like an artificially created image. This is basically a binary classifier that will take the form of a normal convolutional neural network (CNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator model takes random input values and transforms them into images through a deconvolutional neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of many training iterations, the weights and biases in the discriminator and the generator are trained through backpropagation. The discriminator learns to tell \"real\" images of handwritten digits apart from \"fake\" images created by the generator. At the same time, the generator uses feedback from the discriminator to learn how to produce convincing images that the discriminator can't distinguish from real images."

    "GANs are notoriously difficult to train. Without the right hyperparameters, network architecture, and training procedure, the discriminator can overpower the generator, or vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one common failure mode, the discriminator overpowers the generator, classifying generated images as fake with absolute certainty. When the discriminator responds with absolute certainty, it leaves no gradient for the generator to descend. This is partly why we built our discriminator to produce unscaled output rather than passing its output through a sigmoid function that would push its evaluation toward either 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another common failure mode known as **mode collapse**, the generator discovers and exploits some weakness in the discriminator. You can recognize mode collapse in your GAN if it generates many very similar images regardless of variation in the generator input _z_. Mode collapse can sometimes be corrected by \"strengthening\" the discriminator in some way—for instance, by adjusting its training rate or by reconfiguring its layers.\n",
